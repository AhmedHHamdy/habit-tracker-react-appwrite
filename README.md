# Habit Tracker - React & Appwrite
[Project](https://habit-tracker-react-appwrite.vercel.app/)
## Overview

Habit Tracker is a simple yet powerful application designed to help users build and track their habits over time. Inspired by the GitHub commit system, this app visualizes your daily progress by marking each day you successfully complete a habit. The app is built using **React** for the frontend and **Appwrite** for the backend, including authentication and database management.

With this app, you can:
- Create and manage habits.
- Track your daily progress for each habit.
- Visualize your streak and commitment over time.
- Securely authenticate using Appwrite's email/password authentication.
